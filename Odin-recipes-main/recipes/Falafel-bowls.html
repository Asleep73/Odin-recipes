Drizzle the chickpeas with enough olive oil to coat (about 2 tablespoons) and sprinkle with about 1 teaspoon of salt. Toss the chickpeas, making sure they are well-coated with the olive oil, the spread the chickpeas evenly on the sheet pan in a single layer.</li>
        <li>Roast the chickpeas, shaking the pan every 10 minutes or so for even cooking, until they turn a nice deep golden brown and their exterior is nice and crispy, anywhere from 25 to 35 minutes.</li>
